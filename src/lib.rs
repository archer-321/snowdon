//! This crate is an implementation of snowflake IDs - an ID format introduced by Twitter as IDs for tweets.
//!
//! Snowflakes consist of a timestamp (with millisecond precision) and a sequence number to allow generators to create
//! multiple snowflakes in the same millisecond. The original version used by Twitter also includes a machine ID. This
//! allows distributed systems to create a unique snowflake without requiring coordination between the instances.
//!
//! While the original implementation of snowflake IDs includes a fixed layout and epoch, this implementation is
//! designed to work with various kinds of snowflake-like IDs. Our only requirements are that the snowflake contains a
//! timestamp and a sequence number in that order (other constant parts like the machine ID can still interleave).
//! Nevertheless, the original layout introduced by Twitter is implemented as [`ClassicLayout`].
//!
//! The original Twitter snowflake implementation can be found [here][snowflake-gh]. You can read more about snowflakes
//! in Twitter's [blog post][snowflake-blog] about them.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The example below implements a custom layout that uses 42 bits for the timestamp, 10 bits for a machine ID, and 12
//! bits for the sequence number. Note that this example doesn't include the machine ID implementation. There isn't a
//! single "valid" implementation of machine IDs, as they heavily depend on your application and the way you deploy
//! your application. However, common ways to derive a machine ID include using the machine's private IP address and
//! provisioning a machine ID using some coordinated service. To avoid defaulting to an implementation that doesn't
//! work for most users, we don't provide an implementation for this function at all.
//!
//! ```
//! use snowdon::{Epoch, Generator, Layout, Snowflake, SnowflakeComparator};
//! use std::time::SystemTime;
//!
//! fn get_machine_id() -> u64 {
//!     // This is where you would implement your machine ID
//! #   0
//! }
//!
//! // We make our structure hidden, as this is an implementation detail that most
//! // users of our custom ID won't need
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! #[doc(hidden)]

/// interleave as described in [`Layout::construct_snowflake`]. Every other detail of snowflakes is realized by the
/// snowflake's `Layout` and `Epoch` implementations. If you're looking for the original layout introduced by Twitter,
/// you can use [`ClassicLayout`]. Refer to its documentation for requirements and details on how to use this layout for
/// your snowflakes.
///
/// # Using snowflakes in your API
///
/// To make it harder to misuse snowflakes (e.g. by using a snowflake with an API that expects a different layout or
/// epoch), snowflakes have two type parameters. To avoid having to specify them everytime you're using them in your
/// API, you should consider specifying a type as explained in the example below.
///
/// # Example
///
/// The example below outlines how to use the `ClassicLayout` together with a custom epoch (the first second of 2015) to
/// define your application's snowflake type. For examples implementing custom layouts, refer to [`Layout`]'s individual
/// function documentations.
///
/// Note that the implementation below doesn't match Discord's use of snowflakes. Instead of only dedicating 41 bits to
/// the timestamp in a snowflake, Discord uses the full remaining 42 bits. This means that the first bit isn't
/// guaranteed to be `0`, and you can't use the `ClassicLayout` to implement Discord's snowflake IDs.
///
/// ```

/// entire snowflake is taken into consideration when comparing two snowflakes. I.e., if your snowflake layout contains
/// instance-specific constant parts like a machine ID, a snowflake that was generated *after* another snowflake can
/// still be smaller.
///
/// To compare a snowflake with a given timestamp, simply create a comparator using
/// [`from_system_time`](Self::from_system_time) or [`Snowflake::get_comparator`].

/// # Limitations
///
/// Note that some timestamps that can theoretically be represented in a `Snowflake` can't be represented by this type.
/// To exceed this type's limit, you'd need a timestamp that's roughly 585 million years after the Unix epoch, however.
/// In those cases, this type's constructors return an error instead. If you don't need to worry about timestamps this
/// large in your implementation, you should be able to unwrap all [`Result`]s returned by this type's associated
/// functions.
