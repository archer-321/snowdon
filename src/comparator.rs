//! A comparator implementation to compare [`Snowflake`] implementations with arbitrary timestamps.

/// A type to compare [`Snowflake`]s with timestamps.
///
/// Snowflakes already form a total order. However, this is only loosely based on the snowflake's timestamp, as the
/// entire snowflake is taken into consideration when comparing two snowflakes. I.e., if your snowflake layout contains
/// instance-specific constant parts like a machine ID, a snowflake that was generated *after* another snowflake can
/// still be smaller.
///
/// To compare a snowflake with a given timestamp, simply create a comparator using
/// [`from_system_time`](Self::from_system_time) or [`Snowflake::get_comparator`].
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// Note that some timestamps that can theoretically be represented in a `Snowflake` can't be represented by this type.
/// To exceed this type's limit, you'd need a timestamp that's roughly 585 million years after the Unix epoch, however.
/// In those cases, this type's constructors return an error instead. If you don't need to worry about timestamps this
/// large in your implementation, you should be able to unwrap all [`Result`]s returned by this type's associated
/// functions.
